# ooberweather
A small, tacky suite of weather widgets for Ãœbersicht

At present, the package contains three widgets:

1. oober-weather : A small, text-based widget that displays current temp, heat index or wind chill, humidity, and windspeed, gusts and direction, scraped from NOAA public data

2. oober-forecast : A medium widget that displays a customizable meteogram image scraped from NOAA public data

3. oober-radar : A large widget that displays a regional NEXRAD Base-level doppler radar image scraped from Weatherunderground

oober-forecast and oober-radar both require imagemagick, which can be installed via brew, Macports, or from an installer package on https://www.imagemagick.org
